## Environment
The module is developed and tested in Python 3.8 on Windows 10.
* Package dependency: [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 
* I tried to make it compatible with Unix like systems(MacOS, Linux), but it is not tested.
* The bot may not work with python 3.7, as it depends on "Dict keeps insertion order" ruling

## Usage
Run main.py
